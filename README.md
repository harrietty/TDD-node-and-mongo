# Todo App

This simple todo app uses Express to make get, post, put and delete requests to an API, which interacts with a local MongoDB instance. React and redux are used on the front-end.

 Clone this repository using the command line.

```
git clone https://github.com/harrietty/TDD-node-and-mongo.git
```

From inside the project directory run `npm i` to install dependencies.

```
npm i
```

You will need MongoDB running locally. Run the `mongod` command in another terminal window to start a Mongo instance.

```
mongod
```

Start the server.

```
npm start
```

Go to your browser and open the app:

```
http://localhost:8087/
```

If you want to run the test suite:

```
npm test
```

Happy todo-ing!
